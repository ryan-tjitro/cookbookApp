# cookbookApp
This project is a virtual cookbook! You can use it to store recipes that you want to try or have enjoyed cooking. To get started, create an account. Afterwards, all you have to do is manually create a recipe or enter a link to the recipe you used and the project will import it for you. Once you've created your recipes, the app will keep track of all them and allow you to make your own modifications or notes. If you have too much of an ingredient, you can also search through your recipes by ingredient. Finally, you can upload pictures of your finished product and share your recipes and images!
